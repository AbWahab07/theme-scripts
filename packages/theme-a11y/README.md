# @shopify/theme-a11y

## Getting Started

Theme Scripts can be used in any theme project. To take advantage of semantic versioning and easy updates, we recommend using NPM or Yarn to include them in your project:

```
yarn add @shopify/theme-a11y
```

and then import the functions you wish to use through ES6 imports:

```
import * as a11y from '@shopify/theme-a11y`;
```
